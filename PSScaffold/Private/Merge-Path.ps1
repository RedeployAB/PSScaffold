.SYNOPSIS
Combines several strings or paths to a single path.

.DESCRIPTION
Takes one or more strings as an array and merges them into a single path
with the help of [System.IO.Path]::Combine().

Same result can be achieved with Join-Path in PS 6.0 and above, but this
lets us be backwards compatible.

.PARAMETER Paths
Array of paths/strings to merge.

.EXAMPLE
Combine an array of paths into a single path.
Returns "C:\Windows\System32\etc\hosts" (on Windows).

Merge-Path "C:\Windows", "System32", "etc", "hosts"
